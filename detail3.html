							<h2>Dr. Obafemi Babalola (The Favourite ROLE MODEL you ever met)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Ever since I know what a ROLEMODEL means, you (My Dad) and Albert Einstein has always been my role model. Then at some point I added Usain Bolt, then Drake Graham, then Mark Zuckerberg, but this isn’t about my list of Role Models. This is about you, Dad. My favourite Role Model of them all.
							Foremost, thank you for having me as your child. I know a child can’t pick his parents but if I get another chance, I will pick you over and over again. Over the years, I have reasoned my development into adulthood, and I must say, “you and the decision you’ve made has been very vital in creating the man I am today. I owe it to you,” Old man.” Thanks, Dad.
							So, who is my Dad?
							In few words, my “Old man” is a kind, intelligent, patient and hardworking medical doctor, who loves his job and family so much. He is a provider and a problem solver. He taught me, <blockquote>“independency is the best discovery tool.”</blockquote>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi. I'm David (hence; SaintDxve). I'm a Software Engineer who happpens to love taking pictures. I see pictures as a "<em>Moment Captured </em>in a person's life. And to me, a single picture says a lot of words, thereby giving multiple interpretations.</p>
                <p>I have taken upon myself as a freelance photographer, to help people captivate their special and amazing moments.
                And at the sametime, I present it in the best light and interpretation.</p>
