							<h2>A little info about my sibling: Timothy Babalola</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Let me start like this: <em>No matter how close you are to someone, you certainly don't know them fully, irrespective of how hard you try. Trust me, it's the Universe's way of life. Change in human (behaviours, psychology, society, physical, etc) is certain at various facets of our lifes.</em>"we,human..." Sidenote: sounds like what a Robot will say, "... are created primarily to adapt to change. We change, it's what we do. So permit me to say this with ultimate pride, <blockquote>I LOVE SEEING ALL THE CHANGES MY LITTLE SIBLING ARE MAKING IN THIER LIFE; either physical growth, mental developmet, academics, social skills, career growth, etc, I love it all. I love my siblings. And for the record this website was created with them at heart.</blockquote> So let's get on with an unending essay on my family:<br>My immediate younger brother is Timothy (<a href="https://instagram.com/Timbablo1">TimBablo1</a>) Give him a follow on instagram. He is a very brilliant and bright kid who had always loves to create,(wait, did i just call him a kid? That dude is 18years now. Man is Adult!!! Man is OLD!!! 
							Ps:I sang him a weird short recording/song on his birthday, you will hear it later;)So moving on, ...however he gets too timid to display his talents and awesomeness for the world to see. But I bet you, He is working on that and doing better these days. You will love him. Sidenote; He loves Music, last Month, November, 2020, Wizkid was his most listened to Artist on Apple Music. Boluwatife(his Native name) is a talented Dancer, Writter and Cook. Dear World, watchout for my little brother!</p><br>

					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>Hi. I'm David (hence; SaintDxve). I'm a Software Engineer who happpens to love taking pictures. I see pictures as a "<em>Moment Captured </em>in a person's life. And to me, a single picture says a lot of words, thereby giving multiple interpretations.</p>
					<p>I have taken upon myself as a freelance photographer, to help people captivate their special and amazing moments.
					And at the sametime, I present it in the best light and interpretation.</p>
					<p>And I believe you already know; I love my family. No matter how weird it gets.</p>
